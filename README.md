## Inspiration
We were inspired by the metaverse, and adapting traditional education in a virtual space. As students, it was important that we advocated for academic success; thus, we utilized a virtual space to increase the flexibility of learning. Prior to the pandemic, online classes had a negative connotation, but now, these virtual options offer convenience while learning. Hence, we wanted to create something that incorporated common educational values, like perseverance and commitment, while creating freedom in learning. 
## What it does
Captain Pixel's Office Hour Queue has 2 main functions: choosing a game and playing the game. When a user is first spawned into the game they have an option of joining a queue. Once they join the queue, they are immediately teleported to a place that lets them choose the game they would like to play. While students play, they can also exit these games at any time. 
## How we built it
We used Roblox Studio, which uses Lua. 
## Challenges we ran into
The main challenge we ran into was debugging our code. Because we don't have a strong background in Lua, it was difficult figuring out why things aren't working the way we expected. Hence, in order to fix bugs, we had to reimplement many methods. Another challenge we ran into was working together on the same code in Roblox Studio. Although Roblox Studio has its own version control for committing, some members were not able to commit their changes or received committed changes. 
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of creating a game within a game and trying out new things. Additionally, we are also proud of applying what we know from our cs classes to new project formats, such as game design. 
## What we learned
We learned how to design games while gaining a new appreciation of how much time game designers spend coding and designing visuals. We also learned how to adapt our knowledge of familiar coding languages to code using Lua. 
## What's next for Captain Pixel's Office Hour Queue
For the future Captain Pixel's Office Hour Queue, we plan on adding a reward system, where when students win games, they are rewarded coins, or doubloons. Students then can spend these doubloons on accessories or special effects to add their avatar. Additionally,  we plan on adding more islands and games that cover a variety of subjects, such as English, science, and history.
